# Rebalancing proposals:
* Improve rwm reload speed: anim speed 0.3->0.33 (the original was 0.4, so we are only boosting by a third)
* Modify flame projectile blasts to not affect allies (for consistency with dlc) <-- including kulakov firenade
* Kulakov flame duration, radius and reload speed increase (as too many players complain about it)
* RPD sound remake and rebalancing
* Welding torch idea and scripts are from Unit G17; Square edited the scripts and KFredfox did other work
*  Pumpkin box is prepared for the comming Halloween and Pumpkin candies for everyone
