# Rebalancing proposals:
* Improve rwm reload speed: anim speed 0.3->0.33 (the original was 0.4, so we are only boosting by a third)
* Modify flame projectile blasts (including kulakov firenade) to only hurt enemies (for consistency with dlc)
* Kulakov flame duration, radius and reload speed increase (as too many players complain about it)
* RPD sound remake and rebalancing
* Welding torch idea and scripts are from Unit G17; Square edited the scripts and KFredfox did other work
* Pumpkin box is prepared for the coming Halloween and Pumpkin candies for everyone! ðŸŽƒ
* Killing 6 enemies in 60s within 5 meters will now transform a normal werewolf suit into a frenzy one
* damaged Vampire costume can be healed by killing an enemy in a melee attack
* Medical Dart Gun (MDG):
  - increase mdg dart blast range by .3
  - give mdg a tiny speed boost (half medkit)
  - mdg dart made to faction_compare="equal" to prevent heal farming enemies
* Gunship blast projectiles made to only hurt enemies (for reduced gunship tk and increased crazy charges)
* UMP
  - kill chance 0.5 --> 0.6
  - max range 43 --> 39
  - currently, the UMP is strictly worse than the P90, and compared to the other 2 para guns, is just not interesting.
  - are these the right changes? probably not, but UMP40 should feel higher-caliber than the other 2 para guns
* KSxS-6 Hunter
  - min range 9 --> 15
  - min range of 9 meters is by far the worst in the game. This is supposed to be compensated for by a long max range.
  - its closest comparison, the dragon's breath, has more range and aoe.
* M711-LA Enforcer
  - move speed   -8  --> -5
  - kill chance  1.2 --> 1.4
  - bullet speed 130 --> 140
  - currently, the M711 feels terrible to use. bad range, bullet speed, and scope prevent it from being a useful sniper rifle
  - bad speed prevents it from being a good marksman rifle.  It is outranged by the VSS of all things.
  - these changes aim to give it a useful niche as a fast-moving armor-piercing rifle. 1.2 damage is not reliable AP.
* VSS
  - recoil recovery 3 --> 2.8
  - Currently, the VSS is the best stealth gun, by far. Long range, high rate of fire for a sniper rifle, good damage
  - Recoil recovery nerfed, because why does a marksman/AR hybrid have the recoil recovery of an SMG?
* M6 Lynx
  - recoil recovery 0.9 --> 0.95
  - Lynx currently is a worse, but silent, barrett. This is fine, but bland.
  - Given less damage and slower move speed, seems reasonable that it would be easier to get a second accurate shot.
* Kulakov
  - fire/reload animation feels bugged, I always try to reload after firing my last shot, and it just doesn't register.
  - Also seems to be bugged when shooting from elevation, shots go very far past the aimed spot.
  - Shooting the Kulakov sounds like someone is eating a potato chip. Not sure if intended or not. <<I recorded it myself at home. Feel free to replace it with a better one --KFredfox
  - I personally like the sound, but that's because it sounds like a literal potato chip. I just enjoy inflicting that knowledge on people :)
* Faction Silenced pistols 
  - remove XP requirement. new players should be able to use *something* stealthy on Copehill
